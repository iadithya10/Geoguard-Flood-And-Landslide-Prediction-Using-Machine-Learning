Despite its moderate magnitude, it was devastating due to its shallow focal depth (less than 10 km) and occurred in a region with no prior seismic activity and thus unprepared. Around 9,748 people died and 30,000 were injured. The earthquake destroyed 52 villages completely and partially damaged another 175 villages. Entire village populations were wiped out in Killari, Latur, and Osmanabad districts. Unreinforced stone masonry houses with heavy roofs contributed to the high death toll. The disaster prompted India to establish a national disaster management system and reassess seismic zoning across the country."
