# Geoguard-Flood-And-Landslide-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Floods and landslides are significant natural disasters that
cause extensive damage to infrastructure, the environment, and
human life, particularly in regions prone to heavy rainfall. Accurate and timely prediction of these events is crucial for mitigating their impact. This study presents a machine learning-based
approach to predict landslide-susceptible areas. By integrating
various datasets, including historical weather patterns, soil composition, land use, topographical data, and socio-economic indicators, the model aims to provide early warnings and actionable
insights. The project is developed as a website, which will offer a
centralized platform for users to access predictions and alerts.
The landslide prediction model employs machine learning techniques to analyze the likelihood of landslide occurrences, while
time-series analysis and regression techniques are used to forecast food production and potential shortages. The models are
validated using real-world data from high-risk regions, and the
results demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods.
By combining spatial data, such as topographical and landuse information, with temporal patterns in rainfall, soil moisture, and river water levels, the proposed model aims to enhance
prediction accuracy. The model is trained and validated using
historical data from flood- and landslide-prone regions in India,
with a focus on improving early warning systems. Preliminary
results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in providing timely and reliable predictions, making it a valuable tool for
disaster management and mitigation efforts.
