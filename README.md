# Geoguard-Flood-And-Landslide-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Floods and landslides are significant natural disasters that
cause extensive damage to infrastructure, the environment, and
human life, particularly in regions prone to heavy rainfall. Accurate and timely prediction of these events is crucial for mitigating their impact. This study presents a machine learning-based
approach to predict landslide-susceptible areas. By integrating
various datasets, including historical weather patterns, soil composition, land use, topographical data, and socio-economic indicators, the model aims to provide early warnings and actionable
insights. The project is developed as a website, which will offer a
centralized platform for users to access predictions and alerts.
The landslide prediction model employs machine learning techniques to analyze the likelihood of landslide occurrences, while
time-series analysis and regression techniques are used to forecast food production and potential shortages. The models are
validated using real-world data from high-risk regions, and the
results demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods.
By combining spatial data, such as topographical and land use information, with temporal patterns in rainfall, soil moisture, and river water levels, the proposed model aims to enhance
prediction accuracy. The model is trained and validated using
historical data from flood- and landslide-prone regions in India,
with a focus on improving early warning systems. Preliminary
results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in providing timely and reliable predictions, making it a valuable tool for
disaster management and mitigation efforts.
